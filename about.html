            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Modern Furniture was a solution to the gripping issue, the furniture industry was facing at one point. The unavailability of quality furniture, lack of innovative designs, and scarcity of premium quality raw materials. The workmanship was unorganized. China and Indonesia had become the furniture point for middle and upper-class furniture dealers. These pieces of furniture had to withstand the humid and hot weather conditions for which it was not made, questioning it’s make and durability.</p>
            <p>Modern Furniture started the journey to create a local market for Indian-made designer furniture that will reduce the import of furniture from countries like China and Indonesia. Dtale Modern advocates the ‘Make in India’ initiative and thus want every piece of furniture to be a combination of the new design, skilled craftsmanship, premium quality wood, and other materials. The vision was to bring together skilled craftsmanship and premium quality raw materials under one roof and that we did.</p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
